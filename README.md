# hello-world
let's do the tutorial...

Hello fellow githubbers!
I'm currently doing the tutorial and editing this file to understand how branching works.
I tried some markdown explained [here](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet).
Let's write some `code` with backticks. 

```r
library(dplyr)
for(i in 1:5){
  j <- j + i
}
```


Let's try some headings

# Heading 1
1. some item

  Let's quote some stuff:
  > My quote line 1.
  > My quote line 2.
  > My very long quote line 3 which should be added to the first two lines into one big giant quote. This is quite handy.
  > Of course, it is also convenient to add lines for separate sentences.

  Break in the middle needed, else below quote ends up in the same block as the above one.

  > Let's try another quote.

  1. some other item
  1. some other item
  
1. some item

   The Cheatsheet said:
   > You can also use raw HTML in your Markdown, and it'll mostly work pretty well.

  So let's try it
  <ul>
  <li> something </li>
  <li> something </li>
  </ul>

  * some third item
  * some third item
  
1. some item
1. some item

* another unordered list
* another unordered list
* another unordered list


## Two hashtags are a heading 2
## Let's try this again
# Heading 1 is only one hashtag
## h2.1
## h2.2
